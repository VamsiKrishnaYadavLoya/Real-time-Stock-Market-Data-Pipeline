# Real-time Stock Market Data Pipeline with Apache Kafka on AWS

## Introduction 
In this project, I have build an End-To-End data pipeline on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Apache Kafka on AWS.

Key Features:

Real-time Data Ingestion: Streams live stock market data into a Kafka topic for efficient and scalable processing.
Data Transformation: Processes raw data using Python scripts to extract relevant information and prepare it for analysis.
AWS Integration: Utilizes AWS services like S3 for data storage, Athena for querying, and Glue for data management.
SQL Analysis: Enables exploration and analysis of processed data using SQL queries on Athena.
